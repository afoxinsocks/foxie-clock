# Electronics

If your kit requires soldering the buttons and RedBoard Nano to the Foxie Clock PCB, head to 
[the electronics assembly instructions](ELECTRONICS.md) and complete that step first.

# Digits

For digit assembly, the **most important** thing to remember is to keep the digits clean. If the digits get
fingerprints on them, it becomes difficult to see the numbers through several layers. They can be carefully
cleaned with lens wipes. All kits include 2 nitrile gloves (non-powder, non-latex) to assist with assembly.

You'll need the fully assembled Foxie Clock board, a 2mm hex wrench, a utility knife or Xacto knife, and finally, sharp tweezers are extremely helpful. 

## Step 1

Set out the 6 sets of digits and put on the nitrile gloves gloves. This part is a little tedious but if you are careful, you can peel the film off each side as one piece, in less than a minute. Ideally, *do not* break the digits apart before this step.

## Step 2

Carefully peel back the film on the "rail" and then peel carefully along the rail to the other side. After that, peel toward the top of the digits.

## Step 3

Peel the protective paper off the digit block supports, using the same method as with the digits -- start with the rail.

## Step 4

The notches and notch supports are a tight fit. Make sure to insert the notch supports as flat as possible, so that you do not *crack* the digits.

It's easiest to carefully go along a set of digits, breaking them off the rail one by one to insert into the TOP (wide) notch support. After you have all 10 digits off the rail, then place one of the side supports in, then the other one. It will require some pressure to get the side (narrow) notch supports in all the way -- put the digits down on a table with the side notch support fitted partially (make sure it is not twisted!) into the notch, then press from the other side of the digits directly down toward the table.

# Congratulations!

If you haven't already powered up the clock, find a USB-C cable and try it now. [Installing the latest firmware is straight-forward](INSTALLING.md). 

Finally, [set the time, colors, and brightness](USAGE.md).
