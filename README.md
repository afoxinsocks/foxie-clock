# Foxie Clock

## A Nixie-like, retro, RGB LED, Arduino-powered clock

Welcome to the Foxie Clock, a fully open-source RGB clock with nixie-like edge-lit acrylic digits. Or... an RGB pixel display clock, if you like!

## Looks

With a look inspired by old nixie tubes and with capacitors protruding through the surface like vacuum tubes, the Foxie Clock is a fun, colorful way to display the time at your desk, office, or anywhere. Brightness, color, and time are all adjustable directly with 4 buttons on the back, with much more adjustability via an iOS/Android app using Bluetooth in the near future. [Using the clock is very easy](USAGE.md), with 4 buttons on the back providing various functionality for setting time, animation modes, colors, and brightness.

The circuit board can be ordered fully soldered, or if you like, you can solder the 4 buttons and RedBoard Nano yourself, using the plentiful pictures in the [electronics assembly guide](ELECTRONICS.md).


## Easy to hack

The Foxie Clock is powered by a SparkFun RedBoard Artemis Nano (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15443), an extremely cool, fully Arduino-compatible board that supports Bluetooth LE 5.0 and much, much more. It is included in every Foxie Clock kit, along with everything you need (including USB-C cable) to get running.

## Fully Open Source

The Foxie Clock PCB and firmware were developed using Open Source software. The source code, laser cutting files, PCB design, and documentation for assembly are all freely available here.
